Its full metal body is made from a single piece of steel that takes hours to cut and machine. The center body has been treated with an electroplated natural copper finish that will tarnish over time as it touches your skin, just as the copper toys from the 70s did. The rainbow finish on the outer ring can be customized using various methods, including leaving it raw to see the natural finish on the stainless steel or applying a colored powder coat finish.","quantity":1},{"id":5,"name":"Rainbow Flames","price":7.99,"description":"Flaming rainbow fun for all ages.","image":"http://localhost:8080/fidget-5.jpg","longDescription":"Rainbow Flames are small (1.5â€³ in diameter or approx. 46mm) fidget spinner toys.
