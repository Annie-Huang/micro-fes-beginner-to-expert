PS C:\temp\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\home> npm start             <-- http://localhost:3000/
                                                                        It will load, and now if you refresh http://localhost:3001/ it will not get error.
                                                                        http://localhost:3002/ will continue to get error. But if you click 'cart' in the header, it will work http://localhost:3000/cart

----------------------------------------

http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js       << will appear as long as you add things into the 'exposes' section in the webpack.config.js
http://localhost:3001/
http://localhost:8080/products
http://localhost:8080/products/1

Go to each app in the following order:
server (start:dev) -> home (start) -> pdp (start) -> cart (start) -> addtocart (start)

Name of the application or lib:
you can use
home or
home_page, but not
home-page as the name in ModuleFederationPlugin.
Hmmm, I have tried this in C:\react\vite-mod-fed with host-2 (not host_2) as the app name in vite, doesn't seem to have problem. Not sure it works because host-2 is a vite app.


To fix tailwind 3 not working with federation module problem:
https://dev.to/blessonabraham/building-micro-frontend-with-react-module-federation-3j46
PS C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\home> npm install mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev
PS C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\pdp> npm install mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev


Shared library and make singleton download:
In C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\pdp\webpack.config.js, we can see
      shared: {
        ...deps,
        react: {
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: deps.react,
        },
        'react-dom': {
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: deps['react-dom'],
        },
      },
Note04 - Before we click button to show the Header.jpg
Note05 - After we click button to show the Header.jpg
You can see when we click the button, it only download src_Header_jsx.js file.
You can see we ONLY download react-dom and react ONCE, no duplicate download


Error Boundary:
Absolutely need the error boundary file, e.g. C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\pdp\src\SafeComponent.jsx
To protect App that got component which change contract.
e.g. <Header> in <Home> app change to take in a name prop, and the App.js from <Home> has change
     from <Header />
     to <Header name='home' />
     <Pdp> app will break without a nice error boundary file.


You don't have to just share components, you can share javascript (e.g. service api call) as well:
      exposes: {
        './Header': './src/Header.jsx',
        './Footer': './src/Footer.jsx',
        './products': './src/products.js',
      },


In order to run crul command successfully in C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\server\README.md, you will need to run it in git bash!!

Styling in the module federation:
- css cannot be shared within different modules.
- style in js or js can be shared within different modules.
That is why we need to install remixicon in every app.


Reactive state management:
In this tutorial, the whole thing is reactive, becauser you have that rxjs subscribe mechanism.
So whatever state manager you choose, I strongly recommend that you make sure that it's reactive somehow.
And you know, all of them are really at some level, but things like MobX, Valtio, Jotai. There are all very reactive mechanism.
Of course, redux reacts a bit more elaborate. I would recommend using Redux toolkit if you're going to do that.
But they all work, which is really important part, because context also works. I am not going to do here, but context does work in these system.
https://dev.to/nguyenhongphat0/react-state-management-in-2024-5e7l


@testing-library/react-hooks:
no longer support in react 18, Use @testing-library/react instead.
https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/issues/654
https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/pull/991



Things to test in the new app:
-------------------------------------
- Which lint rule to use (e.g. want to import order as well?)
- Use Typescript
    --> Can use Typescript but Typescript support will lost when using remote component or function because we didn't know at build time what the module is like. we only know it from run time.
    --> Will have use '@ts-ignore' for all the remote import otherwise it will complain ' Cannot find module'
    --> Jack got a solution in 'Five Module Federation/Micro-Frontend Mistakes'. I followed it and did it in 'C:\react\module-federation-state-management\simple' with mfe-shared lib. But I don't think it's a good solution. It is created symbolic link. Not sure how it work in prod.
        If you can just manually type one sided on the app that will use the remote component like I did in 'C:\react\module-federation-state-management\use-context' folder
    --> Run time is fine, because run time does not have typescript, only javascript.
    --> Typescript is in: C:\react\module-federation-state-management
                          C:\react\micro-fes-simplified
                          C:\react\vite-mod-fed
                          C:\react\unpkg-mf-react <-- cannot get it working
- Use styled component. (See if you can share import rather than make network call to styled component bundle for every app)
    o Need to test Styled component app is able to use emotional styled which is the gel component library is using.
- Use emotion style.
    o May be the preference since GEL is using it.
    --> emotional is in: C:\react\micro-fes-simplified  (working as long as it wrapped with ChakraProvider)
                         C:\react\unpkg-mf-react <-- cannot get it working
- Use Vite (Vite use rollup, not webpack, see if you can use Vite but still use webpack5)
    --> Not suggested use Vite. Vite use rollup which is ECMAScript, you will need to specific set it if you use a webpack host with a vite remote. and usage is funny too. import ButtonModule from 'remote/Button';, const Button = ButtonModule.default;
    --> Vite remote + Vite host seems working well but I am concern if there is problem we couldn't find any answers from google.
- Use Rspack (Rspack using typescript and Rush underneath)
    --> Same reason as Vite, rspack require another configuration (rspack.config.js instead of webpack.config.js). The Syntax is different.
        Although we got a sample running but I don't want to encounter problem and not able to find solution in google because it's too new.
    --> Rspack configure seems easier than Vite config, at least not ECMScript and Commonjs conversion.
- Which state management tool to use? rxjs?
    o Need to think of whether we have a central store app or different areas of api calls sit with its own app
    o See if we can share it rather than import one bundle for each app.
    --> Jack suggest Recoil or Jotai over Rudux and Zustand because it create more friction to create new atomic state hence discourage you to share too many state | big state (reduce tightening)
        Jotai example is in
            C:\react\vite-mod-fed\remote\src\store.ts
            https://github.com/Annie-Huang/todos-many-ways/tree/master/todo-jotai
            Pos:
            - It's really small, around 7K in comparison to recoil's 43k,
            - Atomic approach allow you to change out use state for use atom wherever you want a global value and it just works
            - An extension to add react query. So an atom can be essentially a query and then also xstate so that any individual atom could be a state machine which is really really cool.
            Cos:
            - A unique way to model data so you and your team may  have a learning curve to come up to speed with it.
        Zustand example is in C:\react\module-federation-state-management\zustand\host\src\store.tsx
        Redux example is in C:\react\module-federation-state-management\redux\store\src\store.tsx
        Valtio is in: C:\react\micro-fes-simplified
    --> You can share state outside of your host apps and remote apps too, like firebase | graphql subscription | your own rest api with websockets | local storage | cookies
        Keep in mind what you do with module federation is shared copy, e.g. a copy of remoteEntry.js got copy into your host app. It's not really sharing states.
- Jotai example:
    o https://github.com/Annie-Huang/todos-many-ways/tree/master/todo-jotai (YouTube: State Management for React: Jotai From Beginners to Masters | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVfw4pRDUIY)
    o https://github.com/batuhanbilginn/jotai-state-management-basic/blob/main/atoms/productsAtoms.ts | products-list.tsx | search-bar.tsx (YouTube: State Management with Jotai: Pirmitive and Derived Atoms in Action | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yxnMGrKyxs)
    o https://github.com/jherr/jotai-pokemon/blob/master/src/atoms.js (YouTube: Introducing Jotai || React State Manager Tutorial | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9usS4l1VD0)
- Test deployment in an environment (do we separate the app in different repo first??)
- Unit test
    --> If may not be as good if you use component from remote, but guess you can find a way to mock it.
- Template app should be created after the 2 apps is created.
- See if you can share more common lib, like styled component.
- Use bun
- End to End test (testcafe? cypress requires node 18+ to install)
- How to deploy the new version of remote and app if the interface has change, e.g. remote component now need to have a prop of 'name' added in
  if we deploy remote to s3 first and then deploy host, then it will get a brief error/down time?
- Error boundary work on a host app that use remote component/service/javascript file, make sure the host app will work if the interface contract is not matched.

Need to test:
-------------------------------
(Try it on the vite-mod-fed app)
remote have a useCounter(useStore) hook and a store and a <Button> component.
host-2 has a <ButtonWrapper> component which will <button> component that useStore hook and also a <Button> component.    <-- 2 buttons in here.
host has a <button> component that useStore hook, and also has <Button>, and also <ButtonWrapper>   <-- 4 buttons in here.
Need to check when you click any one button in host, the other three buttons will update as well.
Tested in vite-mod-fed, it worked.


Comparison:
--------------------------------------
Build Time Sharing:
  Pros:
    - Typescript Support
    - Unit Testing
    - Complete Applications
  Cons:
    - No Runtime Sharing

Runtime Sharing
  Pros:
    - Runtime Code Sharing
    - Can use different tech stack and different version of react
        --> does it really matter for us?
        --> In order to use different technology, we will need to wrap the component (using Single-spa or Bit)
    - Shorter time to build and deploy.
  Cons:
    - TypeScript Support      <-- This may really be a killer....
    - Unit Testing
    - Runtime Crashes




Single-spa
https://single-spa.js.org/
Single-spa fits on top of module Federation. And it gives you a away of making your components across platform.
So as I did the placeAddToCart, that's a pretty simple hacky way to do it. Single-spa does it the right way and actually
goes and wraps all the different platforms and wraps their components in kind of a uniform parcel.
And then you can deploy those using either a system js or using module Federation, which I think is very easy.
And you can consume those in any other application. So you could parcel up a view component and then reuse it in a React component.
It makes it super simple.

Bit
https://bit.dev/
Another thing I think you should keep an eye on is bit. This is a company that has been doing micro frontend / share component work for a long time.
Adn they've been looking at auto Federation. So there might be some interesting synergy is going on there. So definitely keep an eye out for my graffitis when it comes to bit.



How to deploy remote app:

- 'npm run build:dev'     <-- if you use 'npm run build', you will get a chunked up filename.
Open up the dist folder, you will see you got the remoteEntry.js, index.html and all other js files. And this is actually what you deploy to s3 or an asset store.
Basically it's a static application. You don't need a server to run this thing. So if I want to imitate what a static asset store would do, all I need to do is use
a dumb server application. I'm going to user servor so to imitate this I'm going to go into the dist direction:
- cd dist
- PORT=3001 npx servor
That is basically what a asset store would do. Then the following would work
http://localhost:3001   (remote)
http://localhost:3000   (host)
If s3 goes down, I think a lot of us are gonna have a snow day when it comes to web development.


Prod deployment:
--------------------------------
(YouTube: Module Federation Into Production. C:\react\micro-fes-prod-deployment)
prod-test-header/webpack.config.js:
  output: {
    publicPath:
      argv.mode === "development"
        ? "http://localhost:8080/"
        : "https://prod-test-header.vercel.app/",
  },
prod-test-consumer/webpack.config.js:
  output: {
    publicPath:
      argv.mode === "development"
        ? "http://localhost:8081/"
        : "https://prod-test-consumer.vercel.app/",
  },
  remotes: {
    header: "header@https://prod-test-header.vercel.app/remoteEntry.js",
  },


Common Module Federation / Micro-Frontend Mistakes
--------------------------------------------------------
Micro-Frontends != Module Federation
Module Federation doesn't manage state
When the app goes down, the code is not going to be broken (see How to deploy remote app section)
Federated Modules are not versioned (implement error boundary in each app that use a remote component to mitigate the risk)
Federated Modules have typescript types
