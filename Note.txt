----------------------------------------

http://localhost:3000/
http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js       << will appear as long as you add things into the 'exposes' section in the webpack.config.js
http://localhost:3001/
http://localhost:8080/products
http://localhost:8080/products/1

you can use
home or
home_page, but not
home-page as the name in ModuleFederationPlugin


To fix tailwind 3 not working with federation module problem:
https://dev.to/blessonabraham/building-micro-frontend-with-react-module-federation-3j46
PS C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\home> npm install mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev
PS C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\pdp> npm install mini-css-extract-plugin --save-dev


Shared library and make singleton download:
In C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\pdp\webpack.config.js, we can see
      shared: {
        ...deps,
        react: {
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: deps.react,
        },
        'react-dom': {
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: deps['react-dom'],
        },
      },
Note04 - Before we click button to show the Header.jpg
Note05 - After we click button to show the Header.jpg
You can see when we click the button, it only download src_Header_jsx.js file.
You can see we ONLY download react-dom and react ONCE, no duplicate download


Error Boundary:
Absolutely need the error boundary file, e.g. C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\pdp\src\SafeComponent.jsx
To protect App that got component which change contract.
e.g. <Header> in <Home> app change to take in a name prop, and the App.js from <Home> has change
     from <Header />
     to <Header name='home' />
     <Pdp> app will break without a nice error boundary file.


You don't have to just share components, you can share javascript (e.g. service api call) as well:
      exposes: {
        './Header': './src/Header.jsx',
        './Footer': './src/Footer.jsx',
        './products': './src/products.js',
      },


In order to run crul command successfully in C:\react\micro-fes-beginner-to-expert\server\README.md, you will need to run it in git bash!!

Its full metal body is made from a single piece of steel that takes hours to cut and machine. The center body has been treated with an electroplated natural copper finish that will tarnish over time as it touches your skin, just as the copper toys from the 70s did. The rainbow finish on the outer ring can be customized using various methods, including leaving it raw to see the natural finish on the stainless steel or applying a colored powder coat finish.","quantity":1},{"id":5,"name":"Rainbow Flames","price":7.99,"description":"Flaming rainbow fun for all ages.","image":"http://localhost:8080/fidget-5.jpg","longDescription":"Rainbow Flames are small (1.5″ in diameter or approx. 46mm) fidget spinner toys.

Kids love to play with Rainbow Flames because they are easy to spin and they come in assorted colors, like blue, green, red, white, purple and yellow possible combinations. Rainbow Flames fidget spinners are great for killing time; perfect for daydreaming, calming nerves, focusing attention & relaxing; better than nail biting & knuckle cracking. Rainbow Flames fidget spinners can be successfully incorporated into therapy sessions as fidget toys","quantity":1}]}



Styling in the module federation:
- css cannot be shared within different modules.
- style in js or js can be shared within different modules.
That is why we need to install remixicon in every app.


Reactive state management:
In this tutorial, the whole thing is reactive, becauser you have that rxjs subscribe mechanism.
So whatever state manager you choose, I strongly recommend that you make sure that it's reactive somehow.
And you know, all of them are really at some level, but things like MobX, Valtio, Jotai. There are all very reactive mechanism.
Of course, redux reacts a bit more elaborate. I would recommend using Redux toolkit if you're going to do that.
But they all work, which is really important part, because context also works. I am not going to do here, but context does work in these system.

@testing-library/react-hooks:
no longer support in react 18, Use @testing-library/react instead.
https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/issues/654
https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/pull/991



Things to test in the new app:
-------------------------------------
- Which lint rule to use (e.g. do import order as well?)
- Use Typescript
- Use styled component.
- Use Vite
- Which state management tool to use? rxjs?
- Test deployment in a environment
- Unit test
- Template app should be created after the 2 apps is created.
- See if you can share more common lib, like styled component.
- Use bun
- End to End test (testcafe? cypress requires node 18+ ot install)
